  Update to reflect lp_solve version 2.2 (by changing "2.0" to "2.2"
in various places).  Return solve_result_num and .sstatus to AMPL.
(Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to suggest a starting
basis to lp_solve.)  Shift variables with negative lower bounds
to reflect lp_solve's restriction to variables with nonnegative
lower bounds.

  README: add table of possible solve_result_num values.

  README, lpsolve.c, makefile: adjust for version 3.0; should future
versions of lp_solve appear, it may suffice to change the LPSOLVE =
line in the makefile to point to the directory for the version of
interest.

Thu Nov 18 16:02:45 EST 1999
 lpsolve.c: portability tweak: change (int) to Intcast.
 makefile: renamed makefile.u (for Unix); makefile.vc added.

Thu Feb  3 22:39:16 EST 2000
  makefile.vc: adjusted reflecting changes to ../makefile.vc.

Tue Oct  3 00:28:07 EDT 2000
  lpsolve.c: fix bug in supplying variable bounds in problems
involving some free variables (-Infinity <= var <= +Infinity)
followed by variables with finite nonzero bounds.  Example:
steelpl5.mod + steelpl5.dat in the AMPL book.

Wed Apr 10 14:30 EDT 2002
  lpsolve.c: use sos_add() and sos_finish() to handle .sosno and .ref;
add "version" keyword.
  makefile.*: adjust for lp_solve_3.2.

Tue May  7 16:36:21 EDT 2002
  More tweaks to "version" for consistency with other solvers.

Thu Feb  7 13:14:00 EDT 2002
  lpsolve.c: use sos_add() and sos_finish() to handle .sosno and .ref;
add "version" keyword.
  makefile.*: adjust for lp_solve_3.2.

Fri Feb 28 19:03:12 EST 2003
  Update for lp_solve_4.0 (lpsolve.c still works with 3.x).

Fri Mar 28 16:06:14 EST 2003
  README:  mention lpsolve_options.

Thu Jun 12 23:33:02 EDT 2003
  Adjust so "lpsolve" (no arguments) shows usage rather than faulting.

Sun Oct 3 17:21:00 GMT+1 2003
  Update for lp_solve_5.1 (lpsolve.c still works with 3.x and 4.x).
  Created different makefile for the different lp_solve versions.
  Several options added to provide full functionality of lp_solve.

Mon Oct 18 2004
- Implemented the starting base / warm start feature.
- Added new lpsolve option coldstart to disable a starting base / warm start.
- Made building the model faster by making use of the version 5 features.
- A constant term in the objective function is now handled as a constant term instead
  of adding an extra column to the model. Makes it a bit faster.
- Implemented the free row feature. Previously, the lpsolve driver didn't supported this.

Thu Nov 11 2004
- No changes in driver.

Mon Nov 16 2004
- Some changes in makefiles. VC makefiles now also work with gmake. Renamed makefiles.
- Added a new makefile to generate driver that uses shared library instead of statically link
  lpsolve routines to lpsolve program.
- From now on the distributed lpsolve program uses the shared library of lpsolve instead of
  linking the code statically. This has as advantage that the AMPL driver does not have to be
  updated when a new lpsolve version is distributed.

Sat Dec 17 2005 (version 20051217)
- For models with integer variables and negative (-Infinite ?) lower bounds on variables,
  a crash could occur after solve. This because the current basis in the lpsolve library
  can not be retrieved and this case was not handled in the AMPL layer.
- makefile makefile5stat.vc was not up to date for version 5.5
- a model with integer variables doesn't has sensitivity information, but lpsolve still tried
  to retrieve it. A message that this information is not available was printed on screen.
