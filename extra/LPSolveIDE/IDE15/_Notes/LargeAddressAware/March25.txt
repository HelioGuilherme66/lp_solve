- When the IDE starts, it opens on Options. That should be Source.
   ok
- The screen on Help, About can be maximized. Can you disable that?
    ok  see statistics control    BorderIcons = [biSystemMenu]
- Can you add an IDE version number in IDE, about.
             5.5.0.14
- You may add your name there as co-author  
        ok
- Menu 'File', 'Export Matrice' should be 'Export Matrix'
        ok
- Menu 'Action', 'Statistics'. This screen has two grids. Both have scrollbars. Please make the window and the grids somewhat larger such that these scrollbars are not needed.
      some trouble with my video driver? bottom scroll only shows during resize
      I may need a screenshot from your experience.

- Did you change the icon intentionally or was this lost?
        ok found how online .  file app.ico

- Menu 'Action', 'Load Scripts'. What is it doing?
	seems to send to solver for the read file operation 
	called a lot but I do not see a good reason to have it on the menu or F8 key
	Pretty much covered by Syntax check except syntax check uses a new lp hadle
	and statistics.
	I think I will merge syntax into statistics and drop load scripts as Solve is the only action..
	For today I will shuffle the action rows to put basis stuff down and load script down.

      Change Application Icon
        =========================
      
        projects -> Options
         select 'Application' tab
         Click on 'Load Icon' Button

           Select the form
           press F11(get Object Inspector)
           change the Icon Property
           
This tip shows how to extract the associated icon and draw it into a small area of the form (e.g. Notepad icon)?

~~~~~~~~~~
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject) ;
var
   IconIndex : word;
   h : hIcon;
begin
  IconIndex := 0;
  h:=ExtractAssociatedIcon
     (hInstance,'C:\WINDOWS\NOTEPAD.EXE', IconIndex) ;
  DrawIcon(Form1.Canvas.Handle, 10, 10, h) ;
end;
~~~~~~~~~~
