Model name:  '' - run #1
Objective:   Maximize(R0)

SUBMITTED
Model size:       39 constraints,     116 variables,          346 non-zeros.
Sets:                                   0 GUB,                  0 SOS.

Using DUAL simplex for phase 1 and PRIMAL simplex for phase 2.
The primal and dual simplex pricing strategy set to 'Devex'.


Optimal solution                   0 after         85 iter.

Excellent numeric accuracy ||*|| = 1.11022e-016

 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.0.15 for 32 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 85, 0 (0.0%) were bound flips.
      There were 4 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 4 by density.
       ... on average 21.3 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 141 NZ entries, 1.2x largest basi
s.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 1586, with a dynamic range of 1586.
      Time to load data was 0.000 seconds, presolve used 0.000 seconds,
       ... 0.000 seconds in simplex solver, in total 0.000 seconds.
