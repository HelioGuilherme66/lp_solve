This directory contains the files to build XLI XML (LPFML) library.

This library allows lp_solve to read and write model files in the LPFML XML format.

See http://gsbkip.chicagogsb.edu/fml/fml.html for a description about the LPML XML format.

To build the program under Windows with the Visual C/C++ compiler, use cvc6.bat (also works for VS.NET)

You also need the FML source code and library to compile and link this code:
