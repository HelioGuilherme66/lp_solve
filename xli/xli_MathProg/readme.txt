This directory contains the files to build XLI MathProg library.

This library allows lp_solve to read model files in the Mathprog modeling language.
Note that, at this time, it is not possible to generate the Mathprog format.

See http://plato.asu.edu/gnu_mp.pdf for a description about the MathProg modeling language.

To build the program under Windows with the Visual C/C++ compiler, use cvc6.bat (also works for VS.NET)
To build the program under Linux/Unix, use sh ccc
